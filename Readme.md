# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Introduction
The telecommunication sector is highly competitive, making customer retention crucial for sustaining revenue. This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models and identifies key factors influencing churn behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the telecom company.
- Identify the main factors influencing customer churn.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different ML algorithms.
- Recommend the most suitable model for deployment.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Customer churn leads to significant revenue loss and may highlight service issues. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and implement targeted retention strategies.

## 📚 Data Collection
The dataset includes:
- **Customer Data**: Contract info, service packages, offers.
- **Network Logs**: Internet session logs, call status.
- **Relational Database Links**: Detailed customer records.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Performed data cleaning and feature selection.
- Split data into training and test sets using stratified sampling.
- Applied multiple supervised machine learning algorithms:
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Random Forest
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Used 10-fold cross-validation for accuracy verification.
- Evaluated models using:
    - Accuracy
    - Confusion Matrix
    - ROC-AUC Curves

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed the distribution and relationships of:
- Categorical variables (Partner, Dependents, Services)
- Continuous variables (Tenure, MonthlyCharges)
- Correlation matrix to visualize interdependencies.

## 📊 Algorithms Used

### 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier
A supervised learning model that uses decision rules inferred from prior data for classification.

### 🌲 Random Forest
An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

### 📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A non-parametric algorithm that classifies new instances based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbors.

## 📉 Accuracy Measures
